		<h1> Biology </h1>
		<h2> Cells </h2>
		<p class="question"> What is a cell? </p>
		<p class="answer"> Cells are the basic unit of structure and function in living things. </p>
		<p class="question"> What are Prokaryotes? </p>
		<P class="answer"> Prokaryotes are primarily a bacteria that doesn't have a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles. </p>
		<p class="question"> What are Eukaryotes?</p>
		<p class="answer"> Eukaryotes are more complex cells that contain a nucleus and membrane-bound organelles. </p>
		<p class="question"> Name all types of eukaryotic organisms </p>
		<p class="answer"> Fungi, protists, plants, animals </p>
		<p class="question"> What are unicellular and multicellular organisms?</p>
		<p class="answer"> Unicellular organisms are only made up of a singe cell. Multicellular organisms are made up of more than one type of cell working together. </p>
		<p class="question"> Describe cell division and the purpose </p>
		<p class="answer"> Cell division is the division of a cell into 2 daughter cells with the same genetic material. The purpose is to be the replacement of old cells. </p>
		<p class="question"> What is mitosis and how much phases are there?</p>
		<p class="answer"> Mitosis is the process the cell goes through to divide the DNA into 2 nuclei each with their own full set of DNA. There are 4 phases which are prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase. </p>
		<p class="question"> How much is the total of common organelles are there in animal and plants?
		<p class="answer"> There are 12 common organelles </p>
		<p class="question"> What are the organelles that are found only in plant cells? </p>
		<p class="answer"> Cell wall, Chloroplast, and Vacuole. <p>
		<p class="question"> What is cell specialization/differentiation? </p>
		<p class="answer"> Cell specialization or differentiation is cells that look different from each other have differentiated through mitosis and they each have their own unique job. </p>
		<p class="question"> Why do some cells look and function differently than others? </p>
		<p class="answer"> Cells look and function differently from each other because only certain genes in a cell's DNA are used or expressed, when those cells are formed. </p>
		<p class="question"> Provide 3 different examples of specialized cells </p>
		<p class="answer"> Muscle cells, sperm cells, Neurons (nerve cells) Red blood cells, Osteocytes (bone), or skin cells </p>
		
		<h2> Body Organization</h2>
		<p class="question"> How does body organization work? </p>
		<p class="answer"> The human body is organized in levels. Each level has specialized cells that work together in order for the entire body to function. </p>
		<p class="question"> How much types of tissue exist in the human body? </p>
		<p class="answer"> There are 4 tissue types. </p>
		<p class="question"> Name each tissue </p>
		<p class="answer"> Epithelial tissue, Connective tissue, Nervous tissue, and Muscle tissue. </p>
		<p class="question"> What do each tissue do? </p>
		<p class="answer"> Epithelial tissue protects the body and controls what goes in and out. Connective tissue provides support and protection. Nervous tissue receives and send messages. Muscle tissue is what provides you movement. </p>
		<p class="question"> Name each organ system </p>
		<p class="answer"> Circulatory, Digestive, Endocrine, Integumentary, Lymphatic, Muscular, Nervous, Reproductive, Respiratory, Skeletal, and Urinary systems. </p>
